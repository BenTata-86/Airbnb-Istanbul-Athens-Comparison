## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There is no need to run additional packages or libraries to install under the Anaconda Python distribution.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project I was interested about inside airbnb datas for 2 ancient and touristic cities in eastern Europe, Athens and İstanbul.
I try to answer these questions:

1. How will be range of the prices  after the global pandemic and the comparison of these cities?
2. What is the number of total houses/rooms listed during a year? Are there any seasonality? The comparison of these cities.
3. Which neighbourhoods have the most listed houses and price comparison of these neighbourhoods in İstanbul.
4. Which factors affects the prices in İstanbul?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files available in this repository:

airbnb_Istanbul_vs_Athens.ipynb - a notebook of the analysis performed following the CRISP-DM process

calendar_at.csv and calendar_is.csv - csvs containing home_id, date, availability, and price for each home

listings.csv - is used for neighbourhood analysis and  price correlation.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://).
