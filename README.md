## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There is no need to run additional packages or libraries to install under the Anaconda Python distribution.


## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
For this project I was interested about inside airbnb datas for 2 ancient and touristic cities in eastern Europe, Athens and Ä°stanbul.
I try to answer these questions:

1. What will the price range be in 2022, considering that the travel restrictions are likely to be lifted? What is the comparison of these cities?
2. What is the total number of houses/rooms listed during 2022 for these cities? Is there any seasonality?
3. Do location and room type affect the prices in Istanbul? Which neighborhoods have the most listed houses? Which types of rooms have the highest price?
4. Which factors affect the prices in Istanbul?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The following are the files available in this repository:

airbnb_Istanbul_vs_Athens.ipynb - a notebook of the analysis performed following the CRISP-DM process

calendar_at.csv and calendar_is.csv - csvs containing home_id, date, availability, and price for each home

listings.csv - is used for neighbourhood analysis and  price correlation.



## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@dahoye46/two-ancient-cities-istanbul-vs-athens-according-to-airbnb-data-34874a126340).
